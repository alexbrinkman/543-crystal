This is an implementation of the 543 game in the Crystal language.

## The Rules of 543
* There are three rows of pieces. The first row has 5 pieces, the second has 4 pieces, the third has 3 pieces.
* Each player takes turns removing pieces from the board. The player is only allowed to remove one or more pieces from a single row.
* The player that is left with the last piece on the board is the loser.
